Issue Example:

  optional content: related topics (in StackOverflow, Reddit, etc.) or bugs

- title: "FireFox Can't sync user-configured search engines"

- title: "Safari (or any browsers on mac) can't use `option` + click to select partial text in hyperlink"

  content: "Annoying when using dictionary extension based on text selection."
